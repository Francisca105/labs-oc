This conclusion arises from the observation that the mean access time remains relatively constant for array sizes up to 32KiB (inclusive). However, once we reach 64KiB, the mean access time increases, suggesting a rise in the miss rate due to the L1 cache being filled. Consequently, it becomes clear that array sizes exceeding 32KiB no longer fit within the cache, resulting in longer access times."
